The project follows [UC Berkeley Pacman Project](https://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html), where I have done the Search and Multiagent Projects.

* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search
* Uniform Cost Search
* A* Search
* Heuristic: Corners Problem, Eating All The Dots
* Minimax
* Alpha-Beta Pruning
